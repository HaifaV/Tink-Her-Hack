# Rave
Tink-her-hack project 2024
# Project Description
This code is designed to search for a specific product (in this case, an "iPhone 14") across multiple e-commerce websites, compare the prices, and then display the details of the offering with the lowest price. It uses Selenium, a tool for automating web browsers, to interact with the web pages. 
### Key Features

Users can search for any gadget and the app will display a list of prices from various online retailers, ensuring a wide range of options.
The app scrapes real-time data from websites.
Prices in dollar are converted to INR for easy comparison, taking into account the latest exchange rates.

### How it works

The app utilizes web scraping techniques to gather price information from various online retailers. Users enter the name of the gadget they're interested in, and the app searches through predefined platforms, extracting the name and price details. It then processes this information, converting prices to a standard currency (if necessary) and presenting the results in an easy-to-compare format.
